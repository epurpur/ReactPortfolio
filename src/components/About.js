                <p>I am a research librarian at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. I am looking to combine my 
                 Geographic Information System (GIS), data analysis, and web development skills. I specialize in web mapping applications and data visualization.</p> 
                <br></br>
                <p>I grew up in Boone, North Carolina. In my free time I love to be outside, especially rock climbing or skiing. I also like learning foreign languages, personal finance, and spending time with my girlfriend and her cat, Atticus.</p>
