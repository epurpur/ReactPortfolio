                <p>I'm a Research Librarian at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA. I am looking to leverage my 
                 Geographic Information System (GIS), data analysis, and web development skills together. I enjoy any project that challenges me but I love maps! I specialize in web mapping applications and data visualization.</p> 
                <p>I grew up in Boone, NC. In my free time I love to be outside, especially rock climbing or skiing. I also like learning foreign languages, personal finance, and spending time with my girlfriend. I am a cat person and I don't need coffee to wake up early.</p>
